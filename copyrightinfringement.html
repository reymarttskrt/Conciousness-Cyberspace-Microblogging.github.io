					<a><strong> Copyright infringement is the use or production of copyright-protected material without the permission of the copyright holder. Copyright infringement means that the rights afforded to the copyright holder, such as the exclusive use of a work for a set period of time, are being breached by a third party. Music and movies are two of the most well-known forms of entertainment that suffer from significant amounts of copyright infringement. Infringement cases may lead to contingent liabilities, which are amounts set aside in case of a possible lawsuit.</strong></a>

                <h5><strong>How to avoid Cyber Stalking</strong></h5>
                <ul>
                    <p><li>Be careful what personal information you share online.</li>
                         <li>Create a different or dump email for registering in social media sites.</li>
                           <li>Enable strict privacy settings on social media platforms.</li>
                            <li>Don't provide sensitive or personally identifiable information such as your full name, phone number, home address or workplace to individuals you meet online, in chat rooms, social media or gaming platforms.</li>
                           </p>
                    </ul>
                                    <h5>Who are the ones that you can call?</h5>
                <ul><li><p>Do not hesitate to call 911. Report the cyber-harassment or cyberstalking to the police district where your business and home are located, along with all documentation. If you have proof of the perpetrator's identity, file a restraining order because you never know when the harassment will stop. </p></li></ul>

                    <p><li>Someone anonymously sending you too many unwanted or inappropriate messages.</li>
                         <li>Someone anonymously liked your old post on social media.</li>
                          <li>Someone manipulates you into talking to them online. Be wary.</li>
